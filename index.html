    <h1> Angel Tinoco </h1>
    <p>
        I'm a fourth-year undergrad econ major with
        a minor in data science, originally from Pattersonâ€”a small
        town nestled in California's Central Valley. I love staying
        active during the day and kicking back playing video games 
        with my friends from back home.
